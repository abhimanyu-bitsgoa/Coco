#### Who is Coco? ####

Gone are the days of the boring taxi rides. Now take hold of your time with an intelligent and amazing companion, Coco. 

Coco is a completely customizable and open source Taxi management suite. For the starters she has a great sense of humour("_knock knock_"). Currently she is solving an open problem of manual entries in office cabs.

#### Cabs at PayPal ####

PayPal is a great place to work. It loves its employees (PyPl) so much that it provides them with a free cab drop and pick up services from their homes to the office and back. But here is a small problem that comes up. The Taxi contractors need to maintain a daily log of the number of people using the cab and therefore the driver passes a thick register to every person sitting inside the Taxi to fill their details every time.

This is where Coco comes to rescue.

#### Solving the problem ####

Coco will be augmented with:

* Camera module.
* RFID sensor.
* GPS module.
* Microphone.

The entire Raspberry Pi will be controlled by user's voice and the users will have to scan their ID cards as well as faces for the entry. The entire process will be augmented by verbose responses from the Pi, instructing the user at every step. With every entry the Pi will attach a time stamp and location of the user boarding the taxi and will send it to a database online.

Coco is capable of learning new tricks really fast and hence you can add new functionalities to her with minimal programming.
